1- How can you create a mutex without it being a global variable ?
	do you pass it with the pthread_create function as the arg of the routine ?
	Maybe I can initialise it in a struct ??

2- comment je vias me servir de pthread_detach si je ne peux pas me servir de pthread_exit(0) ??

3- I should probably create a struct for each philosopher
	it could contain :
				A) Another struct with the states ; eating; thinking ; sleeping; dead;
				B)
